    "# Task Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify the labelling of a small subset of product and search query data by appropriately prompting an LLM with the relevant product information and associated query.\n",
    "\n",
    "A product-query pair is given the label \"E\" for situations where: “the item is relevant for the query and satisfies all the query specifications”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all product-query pairs in the dataset with the label \"E\" actually meet this definition, e.g. a query might be for \"X in size Y\" and the product X associated with the query is actually of size Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two goals within this assignment:\n",
    "1. identify if records labelled \"E\" truly do meet the definition\n",
    "2. for records that do not, formulate a new query so that the label \"E\" would now be considered correct\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment instructions are to use LLMs, either one prompted LLM call or multiple LLM calls in coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task can be completed with local LLMs on a 16GB Macbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution should be general enough to handle unseen queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra notes:\n",
    "If the query mentions something the product information does not mention the label \"E\" is still valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the product information has additional information the query does not have the label can still be \"E\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample to use for this task involves downloading the Amazon esci-data dataset and filtering down to all records with label \"E\" and query matching one of: \n",
    "* “aa batteries 100 pack”\n",
    "* “kodak photo paper 8.5 x 11 glossy”\n",
    "* “dewalt 8v max cordless screwdriver kit, gyroscopic”\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the dataframe df_example_products described in the Amazon [esci-data](https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data) repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each query, the dataset provides a list of up to 40 potentially relevant results, together with ESCI relevance judgements (Exact, Substitute, Complement, Irrelevant) indicating the relevance of the product to the query. \n",
    "\n",
    "Restrict this dataset to only the three queries above, and the ESCI label “E”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "A table with query_id, product_id, is_accurate (boolean indicating if original label was accurate), improved_query (if label found inaccurate, a refolumation of the query that would make the relationship label “E”)\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission should include:\n",
    "* A link to repository with working, runable code. This can be a notebook\n",
    "* Documentation to explain any design decisions taken\n",
    "* Runnable code is a requirement of this exercise"

The summarisation of the query and product could introduce some hallucination or omit relevant information making the match evaluation step more likely to fail.

This relies on the quality of the query and product summarisation steps which themselves can contain inaccuracies.
